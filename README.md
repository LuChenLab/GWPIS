# GWPIS: Geometric Weighted Pathway Interaction Score

GWPIS (Geometric Weighted Pathway Interaction Score) is a framework developed to explore the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and host immune pathways. The library integrates protein-language models and weighted pathway activity to quantify how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with host immune responses at the pathway level.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three main folders: `data`, `script`, and `analysis`. Below is a breakdown of the files contained in each folder:

### 1. `script` Folder

Contains R scripts used for analysis, including data processing, clustering, and pathway analysis.

- **01_Fig1_Bulk_RNAseq.Rmd**: R Markdown script for processing Bulk RNA-seq data.
- **02_Fig1_Mfuzz.Rmd**: R Markdown script for performing gene clustering using the Mfuzz package.
- **03_Fig1_PROGENy.Rmd**: R Markdown script for conducting pathway analysis of the samples using PROGENy.
- **04_Fig2_GWPIS.Rmd**: R Markdown script for calculating the interaction scores between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and immune pathways using the GWPIS method.

### 2. `data` Folder

Contains the data files used in the analysis.

- **01_RawCount.txt**: Raw RNA-seq count data used for Figure 1 (Bulk RNA-seq).
- **04_Predict.tsv**: Protein-protein interaction data generated by the D-SCRIPT method, used for Figure 2 (protein interaction analysis).

### 3. `analysis` Folder

Contains processed analysis results and intermediate data objects.

- **01_ddsres.Rds**: DESeq2 object created using the raw RNA-seq counts.
- **02_cl.Rds**: Results of gene clustering using Mfuzz.
- **02_df.Rds**: Data frame containing additional information from Mfuzz clustering.
- **03_Progeny.Rds**: PROGENy pathway enrichment results.
